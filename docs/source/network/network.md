# Blockchain Network

A blockchain network is a technical infrastructure that provides smart contract
and ledger services to application consumers. Multiple organizations come
together to form the network, and their permissions are determined by a set of
policies that are agreed when the network is set up. Moreover, these policies
can change over time, subject to the agreement of the member organizations of
the network.

In this topic, we'll focus on the major components of the network, why they
exist, and when to use them.
